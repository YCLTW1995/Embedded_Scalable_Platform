# Embedded_Scalable_Platform
Design of Secure Hash Algorithm Accelerators for Embedded Scalable Platform. </br>
This  project  is  going  to  implement  hardware  accelerator  for  Se-cure Hash Algorithm (SHA). SHA consists of bitwise operations,modular additions, and compression functions.  Facing the prob-lem that using general CPU or general purposed accelerator willwaste the memory resource and computational resource.  The goalis to implement specilized SHA accelerator using SystemC utiliz-ing Cadence Stratus HLS with the support of ESP. I will assessthe latency performance using the RTL simultaion time comparedto software version.  I will assess the area improvement using thetotal  number  of  hardware  compoments.   The  accelerator  will  betest  on  di erent  size  input  and  will  be  reported  comparing  withdi erent optimizing methods
